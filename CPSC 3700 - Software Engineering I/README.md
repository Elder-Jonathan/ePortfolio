# CPSC 3700 Software Engineering

## Course Overview

Welcome to **CPSC 3700 Software Engineering**!

Software modeling and design lay the groundwork for development by defining and formalizing the methods, functions, objects, and construction of an application. A well-designed system helps ensure that code is flexible, maintainable, and doesn't need to be refactored from the ground up.

Each module includes a recommended workflow to guide you through the lesson materials in a logical order. You will typically:

- Read the module overview  
- Access and review assigned readings  
- Watch the lecture videos  
- Complete your assignments

The **term project** will be a major assignment completed in groups of 4–5 students. Each group will deliver several project components that align with the software modeling and design lifecycle. All deliverables carry equal weight, and toward the end of the term, each group will prepare a **5–7 minute video presentation** to share their project.
