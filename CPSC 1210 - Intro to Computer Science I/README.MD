# CPSC 1210 - Intro to Computer Science 1

## Description
This course introduced the fundamentals of computing as well as certain aspects of software engineering which helped me to construct logical, readable, and correct programs. An object-oriented approach to problem solving and program design was emphasized throughout this course and reinforced in the activities and projects I constructed each week.

## Textbook and Resource List

- **Lewis, J., & Loftus, W. (2017)**. *Java software solutions: Foundations of program design* (9th ed.). Boston, MA: Pearson.

  ISBN-10: 0134462025

## Course Structure
The course followed this general pattern:

1. At the start of each module, students will read the assigned textbook chapters.
2. Students will watch a series of lectures on the topics covered in the module.
3. Students will be encouraged to participate in a discussion forum for help in solving the practice problems.
4. Before the end of the module, students will complete and submit their homework assignment for a grade.

## Outline of Course
This course will be broken up into seven modules. The following outline presents the topics to be covered in each module:

- **Module 1**: Introduction to Computer Science
- **Module 2**: Data and Expressions
- **Module 3**: Using Classes and Objects
- **Module 4**: Writing Classes
- **Module 5**: Conditionals and Loops
- **Module 6**: More Conditionals and Loops
- **Module 7**: Final Exam

## Course Outcomes
Upon completion of this course, I was able to:

- Design and implement simple programs based on problem specifications.
- Implement classes and methods when provided the object-oriented specifications.
- Implement programs that use simple data structures and collections such as the ArrayList.
