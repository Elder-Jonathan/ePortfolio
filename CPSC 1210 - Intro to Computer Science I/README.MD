### Program Information

#### Program Educational Outcomes
The overall objective of the computer science program is to prepare graduates who will be successful in their chosen career paths. Within a few years of graduation, alumni of the computer science program will attain:

- **PEO 1**: Success in their chosen profession as evidenced by career satisfaction, promotions/raises, and leadership at levels appropriate to their experience.
- **PEO 2**: Success in post-undergraduate studies as evidenced by satisfaction with the decision to further their education, advanced degrees earned, and professional visibility (e.g., publications, presentations, awards, etc.).

#### Student Outcomes
The computer science program prepares students to attain the educational objectives by ensuring that students demonstrate achievement of the following student outcomes:

- **SO 1**: An ability to identify, formulate, analyze, and solve problems, as well as identify the computing requirements appropriate to their solutions.
- **SO 2**: An ability to design, implement, and evaluate software-based systems, components, or programs of varying complexity that meet desired needs, satisfy realistic constraints, and demonstrate accepted design and development principles.
- **SO 3**: An ability to apply knowledge of computing, mathematics, science, and engineering appropriate to the discipline, particularly in the modeling and design of software systems and in the analysis of tradeoffs inherent in design decisions.
- **SO 4**: An ability to use current techniques, skills, and tools necessary for professional practice.
- **SO 5**: An ability to design and conduct experiments appropriate to the discipline, as well as to analyze and interpret data.
- **SO 6**: An ability to function effectively on multidisciplinary teams to accomplish a common goal.
- **SO 7**: An ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences.
- **SO 8**: An understanding of professional, ethical, legal, security, and societal issues and responsibilities appropriate to the discipline.
- **SO 9**: An ability to analyze the impact of computing and software solutions in an individual, organizational, societal, global, and economic context.
- **SO 10**: A knowledge of contemporary issues appropriate to the discipline.
- **SO 11**: A recognition of the need for and an ability to engage in life-long learning and continuing professional development.

#### Additional Readings
- Any additional reading assignments will be listed on the “Instructional Resources” page within each module.

### Course Structure
The course will follow this general pattern:

1. At the start of each module, students will read the assigned textbook chapters.
2. Students will watch a series of lectures on the topics covered in the module.
3. Students will be encouraged to participate in a discussion forum for help in solving the practice problems.
4. Before the end of the module, students will complete and submit their homework assignment for a grade.

### Outline of Course
This course will be broken up into seven modules. The following outline presents the topics to be covered in each module:

- **Module 1**: Introduction to Computer Science
- **Module 2**: Data and Expressions
- **Module 3**: Using Classes and Objects
- **Module 4**: Writing Classes
- **Module 5**: Conditionals and Loops
- **Module 6**: More Conditionals and Loops
- **Module 7**: Final Exam

## Description
This course introduces the fundamentals of computing as well as certain aspects of software engineering which will enable you to construct logical, readable, and correct programs. An object-oriented approach to problem solving and program design will be emphasized in the class and reinforced in the activities and projects.

### Course Objectives
Upon completion of the course, you should be able to:

- Design and implement simple programs based on problem specifications.
- Implement classes and methods when provided the object-oriented specifications.
- Implement programs that use simple data structures and collections such as the ArrayList.
