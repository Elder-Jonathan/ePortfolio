Welcome to Jonathan Elder's academic ePortfolio. This is meant to showcase my school projects and academic work from Auburn University. Here you'll find a collection of my coursework, assignments, and personal projects, to help demonstrate my skills and progress as a student.

## Student Outcomes
The computer science program apart of the Samuel Ginn College of Engineering at Auburn prepared me to achieve these educational objective outcomes:

- **1**: An ability to identify, formulate, analyze, and solve problems, as well as identify the computing requirements appropriate to their solutions.
- **2**: An ability to design, implement, and evaluate software-based systems, components, or programs of varying complexity that meet desired needs, satisfy realistic constraints, and demonstrate accepted design and development principles.
- **3**: An ability to apply knowledge of computing, mathematics, science, and engineering appropriate to the discipline, particularly in the modeling and design of software systems and in the analysis of tradeoffs inherent in design decisions.
- **4**: An ability to use current techniques, skills, and tools necessary for professional practice.
- **5**: An ability to design and conduct experiments appropriate to the discipline, as well as to analyze and interpret data.
- **6**: An ability to function effectively on multidisciplinary teams to accomplish a common goal.
- **7**: An ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences.
- **8**: An understanding of professional, ethical, legal, security, and societal issues and responsibilities appropriate to the discipline.
- **9**: An ability to analyze the impact of computing and software solutions in an individual, organizational, societal, global, and economic context.
