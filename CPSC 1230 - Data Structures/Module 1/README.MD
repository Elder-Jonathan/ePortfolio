# Module 1 Overview
Programming Fundamentals: Problem-Solving, Correctness & Testing, and Generality

##Module Objectives
- Apply the linear scan strategy to create solutions to problems in Java.
- Assess Java programs on the basis of best-practice coding styles.
- Create test cases to verify the functionality of programs written in Java.
- Apply standard testing tools to create and maintain test cases.
- Assess the efficacy of test cases.
- Assess the correctness of Java programs with respect to a set of test cases.
- Create reusable software components that are expressed at a high level of abstraction.
- Apply generic type parameters in Java.
- Create total orders for classes using the Comparable and Comparator interfaces.
- Apply the Iterator interface when creating a Java program.
- Compare and contrast the Iterator interface with the linear scan strategy.
